            The Hybrid Controller is my SIP project that combines the analog controls of an Xbox controller with the button layout of an arcade stick. The project has a Raspberry-PI Pico microcontroller that connects to all of the buttons of the controller and contains a firmware I found online to make it act like a controller when connected to a computer or game console. This was made to solve the problem of not having a controller that feels comfortable to play fighting games with.

            GPE104 Final Project

        <div>
            In Unreal engine 4, it is posible to program an AI character with algorithms and methods to enable autonomy for the character.
            in this project, the AI character uses a behavior tree, which is programed with the exact algorithms and methods needed to make it move on it's own.
            I used this to program to repeatedly run in a straight line in a random direction before stoping and runing in another staight line in a random direction.
            when the AI spots the player character, It will attempt to follow the character and attack him when it gets close enough.

            This was the final project for CSC211 - Introduction to Databases. I used SQL to make a database for trivia gameshows. Users can sort through this by the game show's titles, the air date, the network, or even by the people who are hosting the gameshow. Users can also use this database to search through the questions of each game show.
