            This assignment for RBT211 was meant to have us use an Arduino microchip (AtMega328P), 8 LEDs, and a potentiometer to represent 8 bit numbers . However, I heard that it would be more difficult to program a potentiometer controlling the brightness of 1 LED using a smaller microchip called the AtTiny85. The potentiometer is both a resistive and passive transducer, and it is read by the microchip which then sends a current to the LED which makes it shine different brighnesses depending on how much the potentiometer is turned.

            In Unreal engine 4, it is posible to program an AI character with algorithms and methods to enable autonomy for the character.
            in this project, the AI character uses a behavior tree, which is programed with the exact algorithms and methods needed to make it move on it's own.
            I used this to program to repeatedly run in a straight line in a random direction before stoping and runing in another staight line in a random direction.
            when the AI spots the player character, It will attempt to follow the character and attack him when it gets close enough.
