    <div class="PDiv">Dungeon Xpress is a cooperative dungeon crawler game with procedurally generated dungeons and a fun twist: Social deduction elements where players are able to betray their party members and take all of the spoils for themselves. The project was headed by Alec Carter during my first Production Studio class. My role in the project was designing props for the various rooms in the game. The role had me learn to use blender to model and texture these props. You can see a collection of screenshots of my work for Dungeon Xpress by clicking the button below </div>

    <button class="lgbutton" onclick=" ModelMove()">Model showcase</button>

    <div class="PDiv">Although I haven't worked on the project since my first Production Studio ended, Alec Carter is still working on the game. I recommend to take a look at his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-g-carter/?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=android_app">LinkdIn</a> for updates on Dungeon Xpress.</div>

     <div class="PDiv">KNOCK-OUT ARCADE is a pixel-art fighting game that aims to bring new players in with simplified controls and engaging single player content. The project was headed by Ryland Kelly and was present for 2 semesters of production studio. </div>
     <div class="PDiv">For both of those semesters, I worked on the project as a design lead. I help create design documents for the game's mechanics and playable characters as well as assisting other designers in any way i could. More importatnly though, I created place holder animations for 3 of the playable characters give programmers something to work with while the artists were busy creating polished sprites. You can view these placeholder animations by pressing the button below.</div>

     <div class="PDiv">While I'm no longer apart of the project anymore, Ryland Kelly is still continuing its development. The game currently has a demo on <a href="https://jazz-boy.itch.io/knock-out-arcade">Itch.io</a> and you can also view dev logs for the game on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jazzboi_9026">Ryland's youtube channel.</a>  </div>
