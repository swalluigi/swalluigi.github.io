        The Hybrid Controller is a combination of an arcade fightstick used by many fighting game players and an analog joystick from normal controllers found on Xbox and Playstation consoles. The base of the controller contains the 8-button layout found on most fightsticks and is connected to a "nunchuck" peripheral through set of wires. Speaking of the “nunchuck” this built-in peripheral contains both an analog joystick and a D-pad for movement in games, and 2 buttons on the back.

        The main innovation of the Hybrid Controller is its built-in “nunchuck” that improves on the original peripheral for the Wii. Unlike the Wii nunchuck, the Hybrid Controller's  "nunchuck" has a D-pad so players have the option to use digital inputs for movement in games.

     <div>KNOCK-OUT ARCADE is a pixel-art fighting game that aims to bring new players in with simplified controls and engaging single player content. The project was headed by Ryland Kelly and was present for 2 semesters of production studio. </div>
     <div>For both of those semesters, I worked on the project as a design lead. I help create design documents for the game's mechanics and playable characters as well as assisting other designers in any way i could. More importatnly though, I created place holder animations for 3 of the playable characters give programmers something to work with while the artists were busy creating polished sprites. You can view these placeholder animations by pressing the button below.</div>

     <div>While I'm no longer apart of the project anymore, Ryland Kelly is still continuing its development. The game currently has a demo on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jazzboi_9026">Itch.io</a> and you can also view dev logs for the game on <a href="https://jazz-boy.itch.io/knock-out-arcade">Ryland's youtube channel |</a>  </div>
