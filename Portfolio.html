     <div class="PDiv">KNOCK-OUT ARCADE is a pixel-art fighting game that aims to bring new players in with simplified controls and engaging single player content. The project was headed by Ryland Kelly and was present for 2 semesters of production studio. </div>
     <div class="PDiv">For both of those semesters, I worked on the project as a design lead. I help create design documents for the game's mechanics and playable characters as well as assisting other designers in any way i could. More importatnly though, I created place holder animations for 3 of the playable characters give programmers something to work with while the artists were busy creating polished sprites. You can view these placeholder animations by pressing the button below.</div>

     <div class="PDiv">While I'm no longer apart of the project anymore, Ryland Kelly is still continuing its development. The game currently has a demo on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jazzboi_9026">Itch.io</a> and you can also view dev logs for the game on <a href="https://jazz-boy.itch.io/knock-out-arcade">Ryland's youtube channel</a>  </div>
