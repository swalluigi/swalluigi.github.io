        I never picture myself as the hero at the end of the story. I am the sidekick - the loyal,
        hardworking behind-the-scenes guy. I don’t want to see my name in lights, or be forced on a
        stage to promote a cause. I want to be the guy on the machine shop floor bringing an idea to life.
        I got to this place honestly; it is just who I am. My name is Ian Sbar.

        I have always enjoyed the physical act of putting things together and creating. I
        remember great joy assembling the cardboard controllers from the Nintendo Labo kits as a young
        child, and then having my eyes opened to an entirely new world upon discovering 3D printers in
        high school. When I arrived at college, I chose to dual major in Robotics and Digital
        Maker/Fabrication at the University of Advancing Technology as it seemed the logical course to
        fit my desires. The fascination with assembly and creation has led me to my current career path
        where I am interning at a digital manufacturing company. Surprisingly to me, I have convinced
        them to officially hire me at the end of the semester for full-time employment.

        Throughout my time in education and in the workforce, I have gained the skills needed to
        create products that solve problems. The project that I enjoyed the most was actually a personal
        one and what I used for my SIP project. I created a Hybrid Gaming Controller. I realize this does
        not solve world hunger or help the ecosystem, but it was a personal issue that bugged me more
        and more. As a fighting game player, one of the most important aspects of this hobby is feeling
        comfortable with the controller. After experiencing increasing discomfort using a commercial
        Xbox controller, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a controller that has the
        button layout of an arcade stick and the analog controls of an Xbox controller. Not only did this
        project solve a personal problem, but I believe it could help other fighting game players who
        have similar complaints. I would have never been able to produce such a project without the
        soldering, wiring, and CAD modeling Skills I acquired from my education. You may ask, “Why
        don’t you market this?” My reply is simply that I would rather share what I have done with those
        in my community and teach them how to do the same thing for free. I have no desire to deal with
        the marketing or business side of the industry - I want to be the creator and help others find that
        joy as well.

        I can’t say that there has been an inspiratory force to my intellectual path. There is no
        great writer or philosopher that I admire. In fact, it would be hard to name someone I would call
        my mentor. Instead, it is the combined works of individual creators that I have come across in
        project research or through my pleasure surfing that have created perhaps the most impact. It is
        the individuals with whom their single small innovations have really changed me. It is not that I
        desire to be like them, but that I appreciate the importance of the individual who innovates one
        thing at a time, even if not on a global scale.

        My community, as you can probably tell, is an online gaming community. I don’t enjoy
being social in person. I don’t read the room well. It makes me anxious. The online gaming
community is world wide - we provide each other companionship, a virtual shoulder to cry on,
intellectual stimulation, laughter and fun. This community is culturally and economically
diverse, and perhaps the one thing that has truly struck my heart strings is the power of
information and technology. Some of us are lucky to have access to it all - fast computers, fast
internet and the money to buy the newest technology. I have watched many of my online friends
struggle to obtain these necessities. I can’t imagine having completed college the way my parents
and grandparents did; trudging through a library, taking notes and making paper copies, looking
at microfiche. I have it all at the click of a button. I know that those who don’t will struggle to
stay afloat as the world continues to progress at this rapid pace. While I have personally given
programs, games, and even hardware to individuals in my community, I hope to be more
involved in bringing this to those in need. An organization I admire is called ‘Computers With a
Cause’. This charitable organization helps to distribute e-waste by refurbishing older technology
and giving it to individuals in need, helping create fair access to technology across the country.
At some point, I would like to convince the company I am working for to provide a corporate
sponsorship but in the meantime I will be sending them my own technology for re-use.

        At the end of my life, I hope someone will say “ he was a dedicated worker, a good
friend, and a generous soul”. I need no further epitaph. I want my work, participation in my
community, and charitable work to create positive changes in someone’s life. Each person
touched, touches someone else. To me, it is the best plan in our crazy world to continue to build
kindness, creativity and appreciation - one life at a time.
