            About Ian Sbar
        </h1>
        <img src="Face.jpg" width="500" height="500" > 
<p>My name is Ian Sbar, a UAT student aiming to get a dual major in Digital maker and Fabrication / Robotics and Embedded systems. Having always enjoyed putting things together as a kid, the last 3 years of UAT learning Robotics and Digital Maker has allowed me to create things I could only dream of, such as my own custom game controller and customizable storage box. I also enjoy playing video games, being a huge fan of fighting games specifically</p>
