                The Expanding Book Box was the first mini project I did for DBM215. Modeled in SolidWorks to be printed with PLA material, the Expanding Book Box is a book holder that can expand fit snugly around any amount of books put inside of it. This is possible because each side of the box are made from two plates that slide into each other using a groove system similar to those found in ski boots. While this prototype ended up being flawed because the plates kept falling out, it is still a great proof of concept for an idea that could assist people with holding their books, which is why this project is innovative.

                This Final DBM150 project made use of both SolidWorks and the laser cutter that is available to use on campus. The body and axl of the car were made in SolidWorks to be printed with PLA. The body is small and hollow to to be as light as possible, and the axls are printed in 4 parts to make sure the wheels stay attached. Speaking of the wheels, these were not 3D printed, rather, they were sketched in Solidworks before being sent to the campus' laser cutter to create flat wooden wheels. The final part to this project is the balloon and straws that are glued to the top of the car. This project shows a innovative proof of concept for air-powered transport.

This is possible because each side of the box are made from two plates that slide into each other using a groove system similar to those found in ski boots. I'll admit this prototype isn't the most "safe" thing in the world, as the adjustable sides can get loose easily, which can cause the box to lengthen when you don't want it too. One of the remedies I tried using was tying string around the plates to keep them from getting loose, but that didn't work well.

            The Warhammer puzzle box was the second mini project I did for DBM215. It is a storage box for Warhammer miniatures. Its main feature is the magnetic plates that you place the minifigures on. These plates can be taken out of the box and be arranged in any order that the user desires. The box was modeled through SolidWorks in 3 parts, being the top, the bottom, and the Axl that allows the box to open and close. On the inside of the box, I glued a metal sheet, so the magnetic display plates stuck to the box. The display plates themselves were also modeled in SolidWorks, and after they were printed, I glued magnets on their backs. I incorporated magnetic surfaces into this build begause I wanted to prevent the plates from falling out of the box in the event that it gets tipped over turned upside down. The velcrow straps glued to the front also help keep the plates inside the box because they allow the box to stay closed.

            The Hybrid Controller is my SIP project that combines the analog controls of an Xbox controller with the button layout of an arcade stick. The shell of the controller (This includes the left analog stick and the button box on the right) and the button caps were made in SolidWorks and then printed with PLA material. For both sides of the controller, I had to print a top and bottom and the parts and then fasten then together with screws. The button caps were designed to slot into mechanical keyboard switches due the the inserts I put on the bottom. The left side has a greater balance between form and function than the right since it is made to be ergonomic while also having the necessary input devieces to play games. The right side is soley based on function, as the rectangular shape and sharp edges lead to a very non-ergonomic shape.

I was initally going to to use SLA resin material for the button caps, since that material also leads to sturdy builts, but that idea fell through when the prints kept failing.

            My second Production Studio project was KNOCK-OUT ARCADE, which was led by Ryland Kelly. My role was to help create design documents for the game and make placeholder animations for the characters. The project was organized and ran based on the Agile methodology, with the use of milestones, standups, and burndown charts. We organized our work through the use of an OPPM and the TRELLO website.
