                The Expanding Book Box was the first mini project I did for DBM215. Designed in SolidWorks to be printed with PLA material, the Expanding Book Box is a book holder that can expand fit snugly around any number of books put inside of it. This is possible because each side of the box is made from two plates that slide into each other using a ratcheting mechanism similar to those found in ski boots. This prototype is a great proof of concept for an idea that could assist people with holding their books, which is why this project is innovative.  </div>

                My Final DBM150 project made use of both SolidWorks and the laser cutter that was available to use on campus. The body and axels of the car were made in SolidWorks to be printed with PLA.  The former was made small and hollow to be as light as possible to allow the car to move from the air coming out of a balloon, while the latter were printed in 4 parts to make sure the wheels stay attached. Speaking of the wheels, they were sketched in SolidWorks before being sent to the campus' laser cutter to create them out of flat wooden planes. The wheels, axels, and body were assembled using adhesives, mainly superglue. The final part of this project is the balloon and straws that are glued to the top of the car. This project shows an innovative proof of concept for air-powered transport.

            The Warhammer puzzle box was the second mini project I did for DBM215. It is a storage box for Warhammer minifigures that contains magnetic plates to place them on. They plates come in various shapes and sizes to fit different sizes of minifigures and can be arranged in any order that can fit in the box. The box and magnetic plates were designed in SolidWorks and printed with PLA material. The display plates have magnet sheets glued to the back which stick to a thin sheet of galvanized steel on the bottom of the box. On the front of the box are Velcro straps that can be used to keep the box closed, and combined with the magnets inside, helps to prevent the plates and minifigures from falling out of the box.

            The Hybrid Controller is my SIP project that combines the analog controls of an Xbox controller with the button layout of an arcade stick. The shell of the controller (This includes the left analog stick and the button box on the right) and the button caps were designed in SolidWorks and then printed with PLA material. For both sides of the controller, I had to print a top and bottom and the parts and then fasten then together with screws. The button caps were designed to slot into mechanical keyboard switches due the the inserts I put on the bottom. The left side has a greater balance between form and function than the right since it is made to be ergonomic while also having the necessary input devieces to play games. The right side is soley based on function, as the rectangular shape and sharp edges lead to a very non-ergonomic shape. I believe this can become a future trend, as I have been going to local fighting game events with The Hybrid Controller and people have been complementing me for my innovative design.

The plates come in various shapes and sizes to fit different sizes of minifigures and can be arranged in any order that can fit in the box. When designing the Puzzle Box and the plates in SolidWorks, my goal was to make sure that all the plates were able to fit in a box, meaning I prioritized function over form. Another function I focused on was making sure the box could close, in which the simple structure and the Velcro straps help to contribute to said function.<br>

            My first Production Studio project was Dungeon Xpress, which was led by Alec Carter. My role was to model objects for the game, such as trees, walls, tables, and chairs. The project was organized and ran based on the Agile methodology, with the use of milestones, standups, and burndown charts.  We organized our work through the use of an OPPM and the TRELLO website.

            My second Production Studio project was KNOCK-OUT ARCADE, which was led by Ryland Kelly. My role was to help create design documents for the game and make placeholder animations for the characters. The project was organized and ran based on the Agile methodology, with the use of milestones, standups, and burndown charts. We organized our work through the use of an OPPM and the TRELLO website.
