            <div >
                This project is a culmination of my introduction to the SolidWorks CAD modeling software in the DBM100 class. This catapult forced me to model parts, assemble them, and then stress-test them, all within the SolidWorks application.

                This Final DBM150 project made use of both SolidWorks and the laser cutter that is available to use on campus. This is a balloon powered car in which the body was modeled in SolidWorks and the wheels were cut out using the laser cutter.

        <div>
            The Expanding Book Box was the first mini project I did for DBM215. The Expanding Book Box that could well… expand to fit any number of books inside. It was modeled in SolidWorks, with its design being inspired by ski-boot buckles.

        <div>
            The Warhammer puzzle box was the second mini project I did for DBM215. It is a storage box for Warhammer miniatures. Its main feature is the magnetic plates that you place the minifigures on. These plates can be taken out of the box and be arranged in any order that the user desires. The box was modeled through SolidWorks in 3 parts, being the top, the bottom, and the Axl that allows the box to open and close. On the inside of the box, I glued a metal sheet, so the magnetic display plates stuck to the box. The display plates themselves were also modeled in SolidWorks, and after they were printed, I glued magnets on their backs

            SIP Project: The Hybrid Controller
        </div>
        <div>
            The Hybrid Controller is my SIP project that combines the analog controls of an Xbox controller with the button layout of an arcade stick. The project has a Raspberry-PI Pico microcontroller that connects to all of the buttons of the controller and contains a firmware I found online to make it act like a controller when connected to a computer or game console. This was made to solve the problem of not having a controller that feels comfortable to play fighting games with.

            RBT173 Final: Wireless RC car

        <div>
            This was my final project for RBT173 in which I chose to make a wireless RC car. The car itself is made from a plastic base with a breadboard on top. The breadboard connects an Arduino to two motors (they function as the back wheels) and a nRF24l01 component, which itself wirelessly connects to another Arduino that is wired up to be the car’s controller.

            My first Production Studio project was Dungeon Xpress, which was led by Alec Carter. My role was to model objects for the game, such as trees, walls, tables, and chairs. The project was organized and ran based on the Agile methodology, with the use of milestones, standups, and burndown charts.
