        <li id="objTitle">Design and analyze real-time embedded systems, including advanced digital logic design, signal
            processing
            and highspeed digital systems.</li>

            <br>
        <li id="objTitle" >Implement and evaluate algorithms and methods enabling autonomy in a mobile robot. </li>
        <div>In Unreal engine 4, it is posible to program an AI character with algorithms and methods to enable autonomy for the character. 
            in this project, the AI character uses a behavior tree, which is programed with the exact algorithms and methods needed to make it move on it's own.
        I used this to program to repeatedly run in a straight line in a random direction before stoping and runing in another staight line in a random direction.
    when the AI spots the player character, It will attempt to follow the character and attack him when it gets close enough. </div>
